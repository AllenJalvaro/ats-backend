# Backend: FullSuite Application Tracking System (ATS)

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive plan for the development and deployment of FullSuite's Application Tracking System (ATS). It outlines the structured approach to designing, building, and implementing the ATS to meet the companyâ€™s talent acquisition needs.

## Scope and Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**: Different access levels for lead talent acquisition and interviewers.
2. **Application Tracking & Management**: Ability for lead talent acquisition to track and manage applicants' stages (e.g., pre-screening, interview, job offer) and status (e.g., test sent, interview scheduled).
3. **Interview Scheduling**: Recruiters can schedule interviews and notify applicants via email.
4. **Notification System**: Recruiters can send email notifications for application status updates.
5. **Search & Filter Applicants**: Lead talent acquisition can filter applicants based on stages, status, dates, and positions applied.
6. **Role-based Access Control**: Different roles with varying permissions.
7. **Analytics**: Lead talent acquisition has access to metrics and application trend graphs.
8. **Integration with SuiteLifer's Website**: The ATS is integrated with the SuiteLifer website, specifically its career feature.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**: The system should support increasing numbers of users and data.
2. **Security**: Implement data encryption, access controls, and ensure regulatory compliance.
3. **Performance**: Ensure fast response times and efficient data processing.

## Methodology & Structure

### System Development Timeline

- A detailed development timeline will be provided to track progress and ensure timely delivery of the ATS.

### Development Technologies

- **Prototyping**: Figma will be used to create the sitemap and high-fidelity prototype.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Frontend**: React.js.
- **Database**: MySQL for relational data storage, designed using MySQL Workbench and dbdiagram.io.

### System Architecture

1. **Frontend**: React.js (Client-side).
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (Server-side).
3. **Database**: MySQL (Relational Database).
4. **API**: RESTful API (with Express.js simplifying endpoint creation).
5. **Communication**: HTTP/HTTPS for REST API calls or WebSockets for real-time features.

### Client-Server Interaction

- **Frontend**: React sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend via Axios.
- **Backend**: Express.js receives requests, interacts with MySQL using `mysql2` and responds with JSON data.
- **Database**: MySQL processes queries using a connection pool for improved performance.
- **Frontend Update**: The React app updates its state and re-renders the UI with the retrieved data.
